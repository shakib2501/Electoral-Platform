# Electoral Platform

This is a Java project named **Electoral Platform** that handles election-related queries using custom implementations of data structures such as Binary Search Trees (BST), Heaps, and Weak AVL (WAVL) trees.

## Description

This project simulates an election process using custom data structures:

- **BST**: Binary Search Trees
- **Heap**: Heaps
- **WeakAVLTree**: Weak AVL Trees, which are a variant of AVL trees, known for their efficiency in updates while maintaining the same search complexity.

## Features

- Implementation of custom data structures.
- Handling election-related queries using BST and Heap.
- Use of Weak AVL Trees for efficient data management.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shakib2501/Electoral-Platform.git
   cd Electoral-Platform
